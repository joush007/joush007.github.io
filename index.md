Throughout the week I was able to do some revision on finite state machines. The way we did this was through taking a set of instructions for a simple machine, showing how it would work visually, on a piece of paper or digitally, and then getting to implementing it in Python. Finite state machines are important as they are able to encapsulate the behaviour of a machine and how an input can change its output based on which **finite state** the machine is in. To understand the topic, we

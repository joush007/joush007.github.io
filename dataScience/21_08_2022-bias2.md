# Bias - The Finale
## Data Science
### 21/08/2022

Biases can be a bit of a hassle in data analysis, as when data that has a bias is analysed and used for something important, it will create a skewed output. The task that was assigned to me was to look into the different data biases and a scenario that has occurred due to the bias. They went as follows:
* Response bias
    * A study of patient satisfaction surveys in hospitals in 2002
    * The aim was to identify and evaluate the presence of any response bias
    * This found a correlation between average satisfaction level and response rate
        * The more satisfied someone was, the more likely they were to respond

* Selection bias
    * A study was done on the data gathered from a previous study on the estimates of the proportion of the population with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and an intellectual disability (ID)
    * Previous studies showed those who have both ASD and ID was about 50%
    * The study used a random effect meta analysis to take into account the slight inconsistencies across how the studies were taken out to determine how many participants didn't have ID
    * The selection bias was estimated to have >75% of the participants not having ID & 94% of all participants identified as being on the autism spectrum not having ID

* Presentation bias
    * Search engines show presentation quite prominently, e.g. Google
    * 2008 Study took user preferences for search results and how important/reliable they were based on their position on the page
    * The closer it was to the top, the more reliable it seemed, even though it is sorted by popularity and had little to no reference to reliability

* Ommitted Variable bias (This one took the longest to find)
    * A study was done in a biomechanics lab that assessed the effects of physical activity on bone density
    * A quick regressions analysis between the two showed no correlation between the two, when there was an expected positive correlation if all was correct
    * Once another key variable was added, weight, the correlation became clearer, as the weight variable was an important variable that was omitted at first
    * Once they were both added to the regression model, the results showed the two being statistically significant with a positive correlation with bone density

* Social Bias
    * In social bias, there wasn't necessarily a specific case that was gone over by anyone that I found, but instead I dove into a bit of research on the leadup to the BLM movement
    * There wasn't much to look at in terms of the inner thoughts of the people, but I was able to look at the data in the percentage of 911 calls in the U.S. that involved using force with a gun, and the percentage of black residents in a neighbourhood
    * There was shown to be a slight increase in the number of calls that involved guns with black officers as the percentage of black residents increased, but it grew at a much faster rate when looking at white officers in these areas.
    * The bias links back to stereotypes held by a country and racism that is shown in society that has, although gotten better, still seeped through into today's society

The biases all looked at were interesting and able to give me a more indepth understanding on the issue of bias in data and how it can affect the different ways we analyse and use data which can give us a skewed output. I was able to use my time this week to find the different ways each of the different types of data were used, and also dig a little bit deeper into them, although not explicitly shown in this post. Next week, I will continue to dig into these while preparing for an exam that covers biases, and I will also prepare a few other exams that will also be coming up.

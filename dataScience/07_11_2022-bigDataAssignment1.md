# Big data assignment
## Data Science
### 07/11/2022

Last week consisted of me looking into my assignment for bushfire data analysis, where I had a look at the trends that occured in data and finally settled on a hypothesis to look into and discuss. I haven't finished the assignment as of writing this blog, but will update the blog with more information after I have finished.

Last week I spent a lot of time creating a [tool for visualisations](https://github.com/joush007/Dataset-Visualisation-Tool) in python that took in a dataset (or two) and then had you select the columns and it would create a visualisation. The tool isn't complete yet but was quite helpful in that I didn't have to hard code multiple graphs, but instead could create a graph from the provided information in the dataset.

The code can be seen here [github.com/joush007/Dataset-Visualisation-Tool](https://github.com/joush007/Dataset-Visualisation-Tool) and the code is commented to show what is happening if you want to understand what is happening and when it happens. The code is pretty simple, but took a while and can still be rewritten to be more methodical and efficient. A few visualisations made can also be seen in the visualisations folder in the repo to show what it does.

I settled finally on the Latitude-Longitude graph with the hue changed by whether it was recorded in the day or night and am going to continue researching into why it is the way that it is. Mainly, I mean I will talk about why are most of the fires on the coast compared to inland, and why does the inland fires mostly occur at night. More questions have been asked and will be discuss in the report, but that is what I have at the moment.

More information will be posted once I've completed the assignment, either as a new post or an edited version of this one.

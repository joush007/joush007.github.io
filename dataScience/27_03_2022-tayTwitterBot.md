# Microsoft's TAY Twitter Bot
## Data Science
### 27/03/2022

I started looking into my research reports this week that I need to write up for Data Science and Web Dev, but mainly focused on one as I feel it would be too difficult to do both at once. The research report is a case study, and for Data Science it's about the ethical management of data, and the case that I chose to look into was Microsoft's Twitter Bot "TAY".

TAY was a Twitter bot that was meant to connect with the millennial generation, as it started with some knowledge of how to act but learnt through all of its interactions with other people and what other people post or DM TAY.

All programs that learn through its environment, though, have a risk of going wrong, and when learning from a community like Twitter, it can one of two ways, TAY could become a wholesome bot that relates well with the community, or have internet trolls mess with it and teach the incorrect things which ultimately lead to TAY becoming an extremely racist and biased Twitter bot that leads to they getting taken down and becoming a case study of what not to do. In this case, the second path was selected, and less than 24 hours after TAY's launch, a lot of the community had already seen just how racist, sexist and biased she had become, wherein some instances she was saying that the Holocaust was made up, and in others, saying that she hates all feminists and they should "all die and burn in hell", and this is just the tip of the iceberg, next week I will continue to research what became of TAY (other than being shut down) and how this all links back to the ethical management of data.

Reflecting on this week's work, I believe I did alright and did sufficient research for the start of the task, and although I still need to research more and write up the actual report, I believe I'll be able to have that done by Monday week, which is when it's due. Another thing is that I believe I have done better this week than some others as I had decent motivation to get the work done and with that, I just got in there to get it done, and that's the sort of attitude that I'm hoping to bring into next week with me as I continue this task.

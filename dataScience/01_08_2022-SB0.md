# Seaborn
## Data Science
### 01/08/2022

Over the last week I was able to delve into Seaborn, the graphing library that is built off of matplotlib that allows for creating different graphs.

Many different techniques were used in the tutorial of Seaborn as it was taking me through the different graphs available through seaborn and how to use them. This was also paired with cleaning of data and other techniques to make the data more accessible and graphing easier. For example, while displaying the poverty rates per state in the U.S.A. we were able to use the code:

```py
# Bar Plot
# Poverty rate of each state
# Fix any missing data with a value of 0 and type all as a float
percentage_people_below_poverty_level.poverty_rate.replace(['-'],0.0,inplace = True)
percentage_people_below_poverty_level.poverty_rate = percentage_people_below_poverty_level.poverty_rate.astype(float)
# Get all unique values to not have too much overlap
area_list = list(percentage_people_below_poverty_level['Geographic Area'].unique())
area_poverty_ratio = []
# Calculate poverty ratio
for i in area_list:
    x = percentage_people_below_poverty_level[percentage_people_below_poverty_level['Geographic Area']==i]
    area_poverty_rate = sum(x.poverty_rate)/len(x)
    area_poverty_ratio.append(area_poverty_rate)
# Create a new dataframe with the new cleaned and sorted data
data = pd.DataFrame({'area_list': area_list,'area_poverty_ratio':area_poverty_ratio})
new_index = (data['area_poverty_ratio'].sort_values(ascending=False)).index.values
sorted_data = data.reindex(new_index)

# visualization

# Create a figure and barplot
plt.figure(figsize=(15,10))
sns.barplot(x=sorted_data['area_list'], y=sorted_data['area_poverty_ratio'])
plt.xticks(rotation= 45)
# Label the axis
plt.xlabel('States')
plt.ylabel('Poverty Rate')
# Title
plt.title('Poverty Rate Given States')

# Display plot
plt.show()
```

The code comments explain it all, but in a nutshell the data is cleaned by replacing any missing data with a value of 0.0 and all data is converted to a float. From there a list is created and each area's poverty ratio is stored. The data is then sorted and put into a new dataframe to be re-indexed and fed into the plot which is then displayed in an easy to understand manner. It also created this output:

This has given me insight into the different methods I can use to use seaborn and plain old python to clean, organise and show data in a nice way. It has given me insight into the different methods available and also through the use of conversing with others in the course, I have been able to see different approaches to problems that I would most likely do in the most difficult way possible, <i>oops</i>. Either way, it helps me understand what I need to focus on in future lessons to develop necessary skills for data science if I do or don't want to follow a career route in it.

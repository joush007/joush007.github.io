# Logic Circuits and Object Oriented Programming - Research and understanding

### 27/02/2022

Researching and understanding was quite important this week for me, as we dove straight into using Object Oriented Programming to develop a button that stays active for one clock cycle before deactivating, as said in the previous post. This task at first glance seemed a bit daunting as there was a massive reading and understanding component to it. Luckily though, it was pretty straight-forward and not too boring either. The websites and documents we read through ran through the process of turning an idea into a Finite State Machine diagram then into a Logic Circuit diagram and implementing that into a logic circuit.

We started off by taking the key idea of a button that only stayed active for one clock cycle before deactivating, and turned it into a finite state maching diagram, using just normal descriptions of how it works, and labelling them plainly and to the point. The states were then converted to binary so that it could be placed onto a truth table alongside the input so the functionality of the machine could be mapped out. The mapping out of the machine was shown in multiple ways, as there is never 1 solution, but some can provide a better functionality than others, and the difference in the two was just the use of either D Flip Flops or JK Flip Flops, with the main difference being the D Flip Flop has one input, while the JK Flip Flop has two.

After those two steps, I had to use a Karnaugh map to find the boolean functions that produce the inputs to the flip flops. I feel that although I learnt a lot this week to do with specific Flip Flops and finite state machines, I missed some bits of crucial information, one of which was what a Karnaugh map is and how it can be used, but I will just do some more research into them this upcoming week to gain a deeper understanding into how this can be a useful tool for designing circuits or designing how a program will work, and so I looked at it and went to have a quick check of what it was, but didn't find anything that told me what it was in the quick look. Thus I accepted that it existed and had uses, and moved on through the rest of the document.

To sum it up, I believe that this week has been mostly successful for Researching and Understanding the content in Logic Circuits, Finite State Machines and Object Oriented Programming, but there are still things that I need to dig deeper into to further my understanding, especially of Karnaugh maps at this point. This week has taught me a lot about the uses of FSM Diagrams and how they can be converted in Logic Circuit Diagrams and put into a functioning program.

# Missing Something for Assignment
## Data Science
### 24/10/2022

Last week I didn't have too much to work with for the assignment. I couldn't build much off of the previous week either, as I was missing my computer.

The whole week I was getting by borrowing my sister's computer and didn't want to mess with it too much, so I used the cloud for storing all my schoolwork. This wasn't the best as I was needing to get more done with my assignment, and without wanting to mess around with her computer, installing other software and other things, I decided to more get some ideas with data sets or focus more heavily on the Web Dev side of things.

I used most of the time in the week to focus on the web dev assignment, looking into the ER diagrams and such, but also had a bit of a think about what data sets I could look into. I started asking a few questions just out of curiosity, but didn't narrow anything down to something I could get a hypothesis for. The questions went something along the lines of: 'I wonder what crime data looks like at the moment in different locations', 'Has the war in Ukraine affected anything drastically, such as the immigration into neighbouring countries and if so, which?'.

These questions I hope to look into this week and get a decent understanding of what I will be getting into, what I can querie, and what I can write my report on. I will also make sure to look into a few techniques to manage the data and clean it so that I can get a good response to the hypothesis and look at its credibility.

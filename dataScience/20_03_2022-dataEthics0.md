# Ethics in Data
## Data Science
### 20/03/2022

Ethics in data is a big thing, as it has no definite meaning but instead plenty of interpretations. This week, that's exactly what I started to dive into, and we started looking into RoboDebt, which was an algorithm used to identify any overpayments and debts of a person in accordance with Centrelink which compared Centrelink payments with averaged income reports.

**Note: I DIDN'T DO THAT MUCH ON THIS DUE TO INTERRUPTIONS OF CLASSES THIS WEEK, MAINLY TO DO WITH THE ATHLETICS CARNIVAL TAKING ONE OF THE LESSONS AWAY FROM ME**

In a nutshell, the RoboDebt scheme was an automated way of figuring debts and overpayments and was used as a way to recover what people owed back to the government, but it had many flaws that led to many accounts of debts larger than they should've been or non-existent debts, annoying many people and making their lives a bit more difficult (To put it in perspective, there were over 470,000 false debts, accruing an estimated $721m in debts). The scheme was later scrapped due to all the errors from using the data and calculating the debts, giving greater debts etc.

In retrospect on this week, I believe I used the time I had this week well and got some decent information and a start on the research into RoboDebt and the unethical use of the data due to this scheme which ultimately led to the demise of the scheme. I believe I could've gotten more done and that although I used the time well, there is always more that I can do to enhance the quality of work I do, which I'll make sure I take note of for the future weeks.

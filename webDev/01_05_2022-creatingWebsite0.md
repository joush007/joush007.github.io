# Creating a Basic Website
## Web Dev
### 01/05/2022

Looking back to the past two weeks of classes, excluding the school holidays which took up two weeks, I went through the process of making a basic website to show my where I am in understanding html and css, and with looking at html previously on a few occasions, it proved to be a fun little task.

The website task had a few layers to it, with only ten things needed in it's criteria, those being:
1. At least one example of each kind of heading
2. At least 2 paragraphs
3. An attached css file that modifies the two paragraphs separately and styles the headings differently
4. An example of inline and embedded css
5. A link to an external website
6. A form that contains at least 5 different kind of form elements
7. An image
8. A change in alignment with CSS
9. A navbar with dropdown menus and changed opacity
10. A table with tabular data

The page looked like a throw-away page to say the least, with all six headings at the top, each being named and with a different style of underline for each, and both paragraphs having a border around it with filler text, that being the `lorem ipsum` text that is well known for appearing in templates to show how text would look. On a sidenote, when looking into the creating the website in the first week, we looked into what `lorem ipsum dolor sit amet` actually meant, and were able to find that the direct translation was actually `The pain itself is love` in Latin, and then a lot of other repeated text in other sequences, as it is filler text with no real meaning.

On top of that, there was a basic navbar at the top with a dropdown that held three links, labelled as `Door 1`, `Door 2`, and `Door 3`, and dropdown which linked to another page with text saying that it was a page only intended to add to the page count, and held no other significance. Below the navbar and paragraphs was also a form, containing a few bits and pieces of the elements with a text input, a radio button, a submit button, a date picker, a slider and a file picker, which prove to be of no use, as the data put in doesn't save.

Finally down the bottom, there was an image of the skeleton of an Elephant bird with alt text, and a table of data which is continuously changing numbers with the titles "Grades", where the numbers are random integers between 0 and 100, and "Hours of sleep per night", which are random floats between 0.01 and 1

The two weeks flew by with the creation of the website as it provided a fun little project with a little bit of Javascript thrown in there too. I believe that although I got through it pretty fast, it probably wasn't fast enough as it covered the basics of HTML and JS and I still took twice as long as it should've taken. Despite that though I was able to power through it, putting in my best work for not the best web page that actually doesn't look too bad. I also spoke with Michael about a few things while doing the project to see what I could do better or find ideas of what to put into the page and created a better one because of it. Through all of the fun that it was, I managed to develop further my understanding of using HTML and JS in creating a webpage and will be able to use these skills in the future.

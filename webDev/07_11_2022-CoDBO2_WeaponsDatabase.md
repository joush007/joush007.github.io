# The finalised database
## Web Dev
### 07/11/2022

In the past week I have spent a lot of time working on the database of CoD: BOII weapons that are scraped from it's fandom. Most of the time spent on it, funnily enough, was for creating the web scraper to pull and format the data so that it could be placed into an sql file to create the tables and relationships and insert the data.

NOTE:
The code can be found in it's repository [here](https://github.com/joush007/CoD-Black-Ops-II-Weapons) if you want to see it for yourself and run the code to get it locally.

I spent about 2 days on the datascraping tool needed for the assignment, pulling a singular all nighter, even though I shouldn't have, but in the end I got it done. I worked on the tool for quite a while, geting error after error and then adding more code to prevent the error, and then realising that the code wasn't methodical and rewriting it. This can be seen with the two files in the repo, those being `datascraper.py` and `datascraperOld.py` where the old one is the buggy, not functioning one.

I then proceeded to continue editing and fixing the code to make it work, realising that it takes a little bit to grab all of the data and run through it all, overall taking maybe a minute to run twice, which is where a lot of my time went, especially in testing.

The scraper worked in the end, and I learnt a lot on how to use specific libraries such as beautiful soup and the requests library, as well as all libraries involved in the loading animation that someone created on stack overflow as mentioned in the code itself with a link to the thread.

This is the last post for this semester, but if you are ever interested in what I've been making at any point, I will continue to update my repositories as I make more stuff which can be found at [https://github.com/joush007](https://github.com/joush007)(My school account) or [https://github.com/SupaSonic007](https://github.com/SupaSonic007)(My personal account).

I'll make sure that as I complete these projects and more, I'll focus on reflection of what I've done and what I can improve on, maybe not putting it into words, but still doing it none the less to further improve my skills in IT.

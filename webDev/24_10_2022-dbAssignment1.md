# Database Assignment
## Web Dev
### 24/10/2022

Last week I looked over a few ideas to get into the assignment for Web Dev, which has me creating a database set up for a specific purpose and then fill it so I can access it through SQL statements. In my last post, I talked about learning to use SQL and the syntax involved with getting data. This week, I figured out what I am doing the assignment about and started making an ER diagram to show the relationships with each table.

After having a look at a few things that interest me and that I could create a database for, a few ideas stood out. I could make a database for movies, or games, or maybe parts of a game. I decided that I would, in the end, make a database for all Call of Duty: Black Ops II weapons. I knew this would be a cool idea, as I do enjoy the game and I used to play it enough to get the hang of things.

Sidenote: For the past week I haven't had access to my own computer which made it difficult to get some things done, luckily making an ER diagram doesn't require too much and I could use Lucidchart to create it. The sad thing is, I forgot to save it somewhere and now it's gone.

I got through the ER diagram hooking each table up to each other, and forgetting to put the signals for many to many relationships or one to many etc. I plan on remaking the ER diagram this week as it is a crucial part of the assignment and will pave the path of making the database instead of just winging it and hoping for the best. I plan also on having a few conversations with classmates so that I am able to bounce some ideas back and forth and improve my ideas, and even help them with their ideas.

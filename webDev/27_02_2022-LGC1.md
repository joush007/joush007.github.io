# Logic Circuits and Object Oriented Programming - Creating a logic circuit
## Web Development
### 27/02/2022
_I love creating logic circuits from finite state machine diagrams_. This week we looked into Object Oriented Programming and Logic Circuits, in particular, JK Flip Flops and using logic gates to create a simple program. This program simulated a button that would only stay active for one clock cycle, and then disable until released and re-pressed. The clock cycle was simulated with a while loop and had an input through a switch, which was inputted once per clock cycle. This would go through a few AND, OR and NOT gates as well as 2 JK Flip Flops to have the button run for 1 clock cycle.

Creating the circuit was quite interesting as it required an understanding of JK Flip Flops, which was a new type of flip flop I hadn't learnt about. It also required reading viewing a logic circuit diagram and modifying it slightly so that it had the correct layout and didn't contain unnecessary parts. Initially I decided to just use the original diagram and take out the unnecessary components in my head and write it all in code, but that created a few bugs in the code, and so I got the right version of the circuit diagram drawn down and used that to make sure I had the right layout in code.

Original Diagram:

The program still isn't finished and has a few errors in it, including the famous Recursion Error, that is often gotten from flip flops, or having two gates requiring the outputs of each other for their individual inputs. All in all, there is still a lot to get through, and although this task does have some annoying errors, they only require a bit of logical-thinking to figure out where they're coming from, encouraging the use of problem solving skills and logical thinking.

I feel This week I have been able to understand and put into use the skills of using Object Oriented Programming and creating Logic Circuits well, and not just do a straight forward task, but instead a task that requires learning something and putting it to use. Overall, the content of this week brought challenges that enhanced my problem solving and logical thinking skills as well as my general understanding of the content covered in I.T. this week.

# The Internet and the W3C - Research and understanding
## Web Development
### 06/03/2022

For the last part of the week, being not very long at all, I started having a look into the internet and how it works (Turns out it isn't magic...). The website at first glance looked like a long read, and when I looked closer, realised I was right, but it was a good one as it provided useful and accurate information.

I got through about a quarter of the [page](http://web.stanford.edu/class/msande91si/www-spr04/readings/week1/InternetWhitepaper.htm) before the week ended and I learnt much about the infrastructure of the internet and how information is transported from one place to another through the internet, what protocol stacks and packets are, and how the commands `ping` and `tracert` work.

In a nutshell:
- `ping` sends a message to another computer and counts how long until a reply is received (or timed out)
- `tracert` shows the path that is taken by your packets to a destination
- Protocol Stacks and Packets are the steps taken for your computer to encode/decode and create a sendable message to the other computer

Although this is only a small amount that I have read this week, I will read more about it next week and mess around with it to get a greater understanding of how the internet works to send and receive information from different sources, like how you're reading this blog post right now, there was a lot of stuff happening to get this page on your screen to read what I have to say about what I'm learning.

Sorry that this is only a short blog post, but there wasn't too much to look at in terms of the amount of research I was able to do in the time period. In retrospect I could've looked at more information outside of class and been ahead of the work. Then again, either way I'm going to go through the information and read and understand it. All in all though, this is a nice start to the specific Web Dev course and is providing a useful starting point to what I need to know for Web Dev.

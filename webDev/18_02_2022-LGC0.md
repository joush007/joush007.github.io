# Logic Gates and Circuits

Logic gates and circuits are quite important in I.T., especially the hardware of devices. This week we looked into Flip Flops as well as the basics of Logic Gates and using them to structure a **T-Flip Flop** and **D-Flip Flop**, as well as their use cases, most noteably that of storing data, and acting as a single bit. This topic was a struggle for some of us, as the main goal was to show us that recursion was possible and that it was used consistently by Flip Flops, but myself, Michael and Morgan all decided to get confused while attempting to understand the how a T-Flip-Flop works using the diagram on [logicly](logic.ly/demo). Luckily, though, by the end of it we were able to get the help we needed and an in-depth enough explanation of how they work from Mr. Griffin, without the use of the logicly diagram, but instead a random image on google images, oh how useful google is. If I was doing robotics, this information would be 10x more useful for me, but because I'm not, it's still useful but not 100% applicable in my work.

In retrospect, my learning and understanding in tbat scenario possibly could have been better, and that will be something I work on, making sure to explore things I don't understand from a range of sources and interpretations to attempt to get an in-depth understanding of how the specific Logic Circuits work.

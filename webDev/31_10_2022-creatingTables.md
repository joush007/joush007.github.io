# Creating Tables for Guns
## Web Dev
### 31/10/2022

Don't let the title deceive you, don't worry, I don't have any guns, or tables that they would be on. That is at least now. Wait, wrong one, I don't have any physically, nor will I have any, but I do in the Web Dev assignment for creating a database, as the tables I am talking about are using SQL.

This week I looked into using the sql for making the tables and databases that I still need to scrape from the fandom of COD: Black Ops II weapons, which is pretty cool. I will then use this data and throw it straight into the database and it should work. I started off by thinking of the previous ER diagram that I made and forgot to save, and then creating tables for them. These were the Guns, Classes, Attachments and one other which I forgot, and so I didn't add it in. I will be revising the ER diagram and the way that each of these connect to create the least repetition and the easiest to query.

Once the ER diagram is remade I will post it to the blog (Probably my next one or I'll add an edit with it) to represent what the database is intended to look like. I am a bit limited in what to talk about today, but I can say that I have a database design and a created table with most of the attributes, but it may be missing some, and I have looked into a little bit of web scraping and the use of Beautiful Soup. I will put an update next week of exactly what I have learnt on it and how I will use it, but I can't just yet as I have looked into it enough.

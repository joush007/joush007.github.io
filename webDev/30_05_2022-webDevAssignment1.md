# Progressing through the website
## Web Dev
### 30/05/2022

This past week I have been progressing through the assignment at a decent rate, getting through some of the major parts of the assignment, and starting on others. The parts I have done so far are the Wireframe, showing the basic layout of the webpage, and _almost_ the Sitemap, which will show how all the different pages on the site will connect to each other. Finally I have chipped into the creation of the actual pages and am at the point where I almost have the product page completed, besides finding a color palette which would work for the site and be a bit easy on the eyes.

The Wireframe was probably one of the easiest parts of the process, requiring me to create some ideas that would lead to a useful and informative product page that was organised, informative and not hard to look at. This was done through another site called <a href="https://wireframe.cc">wireframe.cc</a> and my sitemap can be seen in the image below showing the design that was planned out for the products page.

From there I was able to start the actual creation of my website. I started with creating the basic layout shown in the image above, with each different section of the page shown with different colours, those being the navbar on the left and the four quadrants that made up the main parts of the products page, I would show an image below but I forgot to take a screenshot of the page itself, and so I will just have to describe it. On top of that I created a simple Danko Logo which was just the word DANKO in a nice font, because why not, and added that into the page alongside an image for the airfryer I was going to sell, and the placement for all the elements can be seen in the sitemap above. That pretty much concludes the point I've reached now, and although it seems like it wasn't much, there was a decent amount of time taken to complete this simple page, and I'm proud of the point I'm up to.

Looking back over my progress throughout each week makes me think I could have done better, which is something I seem to state every week, saying that I hadn't used my time to the best of my ability. This week, though, I believe that I have gotten a lot done and I am proud of what I have produced for the assignment. I possibly could have gotten more done outside of class but even when I'm at home, I need a break sometimes, whether that be taking ten to fifteen minutes to just stop and take a breath, or to go do something else that I enjoy. With all of that in mind, I produced a result that I'm proud of and was able to get through a decent chunk of the assignment this week. Now I just need to do the other four pages in this week as the assignment's all due on next Monday..

That's the plan then, for this week I'm going to focus on getting through the rest of the assignment, using my time well and not getting sidetracked by other things happening around the class.

In Web Dev I believed I did well to smash out the assignment in the time I had been given, I mimght have even taken a bit too much time as in the end I started taking away from the Data Science assignment. The end product can be seen <a href="./Web Dev Assignment/index.html">Here</a> and took me a while to make, even though I was a bit more optimised with my efforts.

In timeline order of the week:
* First, I did the product page, that being the one for the Air Fryer. I got into working out the layout and making it all fit together well, and then adding in the different aspects inside of it. 
* Then I made the products page and made it able to dynamically take all of the different products of a JSON and put them into containers on the product page, fitting snugly beside each other, with an accidental gap on the right.
* Next, I created a bunch more 'products' to put into the JSON so that they'd be listed in the products page.
* From there I decided I needed a quiz page, kind of making it a joke, but also adding in functionality that would allow answers to be submitted and compared to the real answers
* Second last, I created the contact page, which has an 'email' box where you specify your email and a message which will be sent to the company, as well as a phone number for calling the company (not a real phone number I don't think.)
* Finally I created an Index page, filled with `Lorem ipsum` text and a filler image that has [insert image here] points where there would theoretically be an image.

The whole week went by pretty fast and stressfully, due to having five assessments known to be due all on the next Monday, I was questioning my capability of even getting **one** in... Luckily though I was able to smash out a lot of it over the weekend, and to good measures, as the _practically_ final project can be seen in the hyperlink above.

My goal was to get the assignment done last week, and I got it done. I enjoyed the process, and the different bits of creativity required to make the site interesting and functional. Reflecting back on it all, I used my web dev time effectively and was able to get a ton of it done over the weekend. This has allowed me to look into the different methods I would be able to use to tackle the small problems and the many bugs I ran into along the way...

This has been a fun assignment and I am looking forward to looking into more Web Dev stuff next semester, and as usual my goal is to be better with my time, figuring out how to use it efficiently and **STARTING ASSIGNMENTS EARLY**.

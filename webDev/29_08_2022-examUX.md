# Exam - UX
## Web Dev
### 29/08/2022

Last week not much happened, so I have not much to talk about as no classes were help (except for the Monday) and I had exams, although I can also talk about some other study into UX that I also had to study for the exam as I was a little bit behind on the classwork.

The focus of the week was on UX a.k.a. User Experience, and how that directly influences how successful the page can be. To keep it simple, there are 8 rules of UX that need to be followed to create a decent website, those being:

* Strive for consistency - Keep the pages/style consistent
* Seek universal usability - Allow accessibility from everyone
* Offer informative feedback - Give feedback on what's happening
* Design dialogs to yield closure - Make sure the user knows exactly what's happening on the page
* Offer simple error handling - If there's an error, make sure it is easily readable and understandable
* Permit easy reversal of actions - Making mistakes happen, don't make people stress by not allowing a mistake to be reversed
* Keep users in control - Make sure the users are in control at all times
* Reduce short-term memory load - Keep it minimalistic at times, no need to overload the brain

These rules to UX were also in the exam, where I needed to talk about the use of these in the success of websites, specifically in relation to LINGsCARS and the CSS Zen Garden, which took two completely different approaches to creating a website and the effects created were substantially different, although attacking certain parts of the UX similarly. The analysis of the sites used my previous understanding of how web pages are created and the effect it has on the interpretation of the page. I concluded that the UX does have an effect on how well the site performs but is not the entirety of what makes a page successful.

This week on the other hand I am looking into local storage, where I will continue to develop my understanding to the point of knowing it like second nature, but also the plan is not to overload myself with schoolwork and give myself a bit of time to just do what I'd like and keep a bit of a balanced life as sometimes it just gets too overwhelming, so I need a minute to stop and just do what I enjoy.

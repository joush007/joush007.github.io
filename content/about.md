Hey I'm Josh, a year 12 student studying web development and data science. I've got a few skills up my sleeve and a few things I've learnt through I.T. and also some other things outside of school I've participated in such as the Lockheed Martin competitions and PeCan+.

This website is for progress updates on what I'm doing in class and what I'm studying so that I have a record of what I've done and what I've learnt and a platform to share these ideas and concepts with others. I love I.T. and learning new concepts so I'm hoping this will be a good way to share my knowledge and learning with others to benefit them and also to help me learn and understand the concepts better.

I'm excited to continue learning and sharing my knowledge with others and I hope you enjoy my website.

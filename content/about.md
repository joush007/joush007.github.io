Hey I'm Josh, a year 12 student studying web development and data science. I've got a few skills up my sleeve and a few things I've learnt through I.T. and also some other things outside of school I've participated in such as the Lockheed Martin competitions and PeCan+.

This website is for progress updates on what I'm doing in class and what I'm studying so that I have a record of what I've done and what I've learnt and a platform to share these ideas and concepts with others. I love I.T. and learning new concepts so I'm hoping this will be a good way to share my knowledge and learning with others to benefit them and also to help me learn and understand the concepts better.

I'm one of the three people involved in creating W.I.N.S.T.O.N. the robot dog, which is a cool project that's being developed for a large year 12 project alongside Sam and Morgan, the other two team members. Whilst not directly involved with the Robot Dog's robotics area, I'm a part of the user interaction development, creating a website that will display Winston's vision and also provide itself as a platform to share ideas and concepts with others on the Winstogram side of it. Information related to it can be found here:

* [Morgan's Blog](https://Morgan-Potter.github.io)

* [Sam's Blog](https://samsidebotham.com)

* [GitHub Repository - Winston](https://github.com/joush007/WINSTON) - All parts of the project are linked through submodules

I'm excited to continue learning and sharing my knowledge with others and I hope you enjoy reading about the progress, and possibly even learn a thing or two yourself.

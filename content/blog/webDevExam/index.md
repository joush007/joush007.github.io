## The Exam...
Last week was the In Class Assessment Week (`ICAW`), which was a week dedicate to in class assessments for school. It would have one of the three semesterly assessments for each class that I'm apart of, those being `Data Science, Web Dev, Math, English and History`.

The exam for web dev was all about the necessity for WCAG on the internet for a goob website, with the question being along the lines of: `Do good websites need to follow accessibility requirements?`.

We had 70 minutes to write on the question, with references to the stimulus provided. In web dev, the stimulus linked back to [LINGsCARS](https://www.lingscars.com/), which is a website for car hires in the UK, and [CSS Zen Garden](https://www.csszengarden.com), which is a website designed to show the true power of CSS through example designs.

To write on the issue I took a positive stance, saying that a good website is defined by the way it follows accessibility guidelines, and that a website that doesn't follow these guidelines tends not to do so well, which could be seen through lawsuits against sites like [Netflix](https://netflix.com) and [Amazon](https://amazon.com), who failed to follow the guidelines that were widely accepted online and became a fundamental part of building an accessible internet.

The W3C (World Wide Web Consortium) was the reason that these guidelines are so widely used and accepted today, and that failure to uphold these standards will result in a 'bad' website, or one that is not accessible to all users, which is how I defined it in my response. If you'd like to read more about the W3C, you can do so in one of my previous, archived, posts [here](https://github.com/joush007/joush007.github.io/blob/yr-11-archived/webDev/03_04_2022-w3cAssignment.md) or on the official W3C website @ [w3.org](https://w3.org/).

## Conclusion
Overall, the exam did go quite well, as I was able to smash out approximately 1100 words in the 70 minutes provided with useful information that related to the question and answered it to, in my mind at least, a decent degree. I am happy with the progress made in it, as I was able to take the information that I had learnt from last year about the W3C and WCAG and apply the knowledge to the question in the exam.

# Context
Hey there, so this will mostly be a quick post to give a plan as to what I'm going to be doing throughout the coming weeks and what I need to look into for the coming weeks in accordance with the project I'm doing with Sam and Morgan.

For some context:

* Sam and Morgan are two of my classmates that I haven't mentioned previously

* As a part of the course, for year 12, there is a project that we will do for 3 terms (2-4)

* This project is going to be used not only for the assignment but also for PyCon which will be held in person ... \[[About](https://2023.pycon.org.au/)\]

* We have a first target for the project to be finished a basic version (something that can actually be accomplished in a term) around the end of term 2

**NOTE**: The points above are the exact same as in the Data Science post, but they give context to the project in case you haven't read it

# The Project
Great, now that we have context, here's the idea:

Sam, Morgan and I will be building a robot dog named W.I.N.S.T.O.N.. They will be working on the robotics side of it while I will be working on a server side (if that's what we wanna call it). This means that I will be looking into setting up a server for W.I.N.S.T.O.N. as well as a dynamic website that has a login and live streams what W.I.N.S.T.O.N. sees onto the website (which from there I'm unsure what I will do, but when that is figured out, the table below will be updated with the new information)

Here's what I will have to look into to make this work.

|To Do|Done|
|-|-|
|Setup connection to W.I.N.S.T.O.N. to allow data flow for CV||
|Setup a python flask server| |
|Create a Home Page| |
|Create Users (with Username, Password [Hashed] and Avatar)||
|Add admin page (For anything that might need to be sent to or from W.I.N.S.T.O.N. directly [UNCOMFIRMED, will have to talk with the boys about it])||
|Create Profile pages (Ideas to what to add for Users will add here)||
|Add user collections (I have to figure out what that means [from the assessment page])||
|When not logged in, go to home page||
|Create a W.I.N.S.T.O.N. page where the render will be streamed (This will be viewable by anyone but messages can be sent when logged in)||
|Display live stream||
|Any other ideas will be added to the table if this changes||

This table will be placed in the future posts so that I can refer back to it and continually work through the different items, with that I should be able to get the server and dynamic website up and running. The, though, I will need to create a connection between my computer and Winston to create a constant data stream that can be inputted into blender (This will be a part of the Web Dev, but if it changes, the table will update).

I'm looking forward to implementing this in the coming weeks, I'll keep you updated.

**NOTE**: In the holidays I did work through up until chapter 15 of the Flask Mega-Tutorial, getting a fair understanding of how to use flask and different packages made for Falsk (As well as database integration).

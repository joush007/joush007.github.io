I started using this blog template earlier this year, testing out Hugo and seeing what I could accomplish with it. One of the first things that I checked out was the images for each page that could be added. On the first few posts that I made, I didn't know how to use them or implement them, nor did I have any experience in art at all, so I didn't make any images to use for the site by hand.

After a while, I was introduced to Dall-E, which is what I initially used for the image generation for this site. I experimented with it quite a bit to learn how to get the most out of it, and how to structure prompts, which allowed me to create my first few images for my posts. I immediately added those to the site, and they can still be seen on the site as the first few posts. I then learnt about BingAI's image generation tool which is built off of Dall-E but still generates different styles of images with the same prompt. At this point in time, I am still using BingAI for all of my image generation, but it is also explicitly stated in the about page on this site.

The evolution of images can be seen quite clearly with the increase of the change in style over each generation of posts. They started out quite simple and 2D, but started to become more complex, taking on different styles as I experimented with them each week. I went from the simplistic style into a more detailed 2D style, then starting to push into the territory of 3D and Sci-Fi and Vaporwave, which didn't last long. As of the time this has been posted, there will be a similar style in the most recent posts and that is due to what I'm talking about here.

I realised that I have continued posting for a while now, but I have forgotten to continue generating and having cover images for each post on the site, and I realised "wow that's boring, I think the images really make the posts come alive", and so I spent about an hour or two, craeting prompts and generating images that would work best for each of the previous posts that I have forgotten to add an image too.

The results, I realised, were really good. I believe I was right about how they make the posts feel and are better for captivating whoever is reading the post and drawing their attention into what the post may be about. As the saying goes, "A picture says a thousand words", and people have to read every day for whatever reason. Everyone loves looking at things that are cool and exciting, and I wanted my site to be fun and informative, so I added some new images and voila, now the pages are that much more fun to look at and try and find something of interesting (Now I just need to work on adding more images into the posts).

# PyCon Au 2023
So as you may know, PyCon is a big python conference that happens once a year over 3 days with a 2 day sprint. Over the 3 main days, there would be a lot of talks about people's projects and ideas with Python, such as someone creating a new Web Framework that is faster than Flask and built on Rust, which was one of the talks this year. It was held in Adelaide this year, and Team Winston was there as a part of the Student Showcase to present Winston. We presented on the first day, and so didn't get much time to see other presentations as we spent the day practicing, but by the presentation we were definitely prepared to present our progress with the dog. We talked for about 10 minutes and made a good impact on the room with a lot of jokes and fun moments from the project as well as making sure to explain the project and everyone's roles in it. The presentation was recorded and will be uploaded to YouTube under [PyCon Au](https://www.youtube.com/@PyConAU/videos). When it's up there will be a link here, but the slides for the presentation can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1vnRfrF9SaiewQkWk5vjchrFpHF1ImAAL/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=113953752472373221728&rtpof=true&sd=true).

# I know, I know
I know that I'm not talking about much, but that's because I don't want to spoil the presentation too much. I can say, though, that the presentation was a massive success, and it was great to see other people's projects too. Overall we had a great time and it was a great experience to present at a conference like this, especially as Year 12 Students. I hope that we can present again next year as a part of the main conference, as I think the boys and I are going to apply, but we'll see what happens.

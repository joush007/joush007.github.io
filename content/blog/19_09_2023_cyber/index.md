# Pentester Labs
Firstly, I'm sorry for the unstructured nature of this blog post, I'm mainly talking about Pentester Labs and I don't have too much to talk about, so if you'd like to go to the site and check it out, I'll link it [here](https://pentesterlab.com/).

With Sam, Morgan, Michael and I all competing in Pecan earlier this year (approx a month or 2 ago) and placing third in our division, we all won a 6 month subscription to Pentester Labs pro. Pentester labs is a cool Penetration Testing learning site where you get to learn all of the bits and bobs for ethical hacking. It teaches you how to use linux and attack websites and servers correctly. Last week I started using the subscription, and worked through the tutorial on how to use the site, and then started working on their intro to unix, which I have almost completed. I am unable to talk specifically about the activity I was faced with as they have a massive `<h2>` or something on the site that says not to post write-ups of the pro-content. I will, however, link the site [here](https://pentesterlab.com/) in case you want to read about it. I have also been looking further into the use of [hackthebox](https://hackthebox.com/) and [tryhackme](https://tryhackme.com/), which are also very good for their own reasons and I would recommend checking them out if you are interested in cyber security and pen-testing, although they do feature some blue-teaming too.

# Summary
I have been working through a little bit of [Pentester Lab](https://pentesterlab.com/) and have been looking into [hackthebox](https://hackthebox.com/) and [tryhackme](https://tryhackme.com/) as resources to improve my red-teaming skills, and would highly recommend them for improving. I have also received recommendations to do it from industry professionals who were in the top 0.1% who got a job in pen-testing and have told me that this is one of the things that they look for in a candidate, that being experience. I will be continuing to work through Pentester Lab and will be looking into hackthebox and tryhackme more in the future. This is the last post of the term for me, as I have the holidays coming up, but I will get back into it next term and really get myself going and working through all that I need to do.

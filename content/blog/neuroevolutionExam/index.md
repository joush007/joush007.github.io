Last week I had an exam on the topic of Neuroevolution, which is a topic that, as stated in previous posts, I am very interested in. It was an hour long exam which talked about how useful machine learning as a whole is, which I took a positive approach to, talking about how ML is extremely useful in the modern day and age and how it can be used in specific situations. I talked about the fact that ML can be used in almost any field as long as you are able to train it for that field, and the main limitation of ML modes comes from the person who made and trained the model. This leads to the disproving of the idea that ML models are flawed in themselves, which was actually what the prompt was about.

Just as a quick note, I didn't get anything done on the Monte Carlo work that we were looking into in the previous week, but I will be resuming that work this week.

As a recap for the exam, I had to look into the effectiveness of Machine Learning against the power of human brains at tasks, and I talked about all the great things that Machine Learning has produced, such as ChatGPT, DALL-E, Bing AI and other ML models that are widespread and frequently used.

In preparation for the task I looked into a decent amount of Neuroevolution information, one being from towardsdatascience as stated in the previous post (if you'd like to see the notes, head to the last Data Science post).

That's about all that I looked into last week and in preparation for last week. There isn't much else to say about last week as I had nothing else I was doing besides the exam and study for other exams, so I didn't get much done on the I.T. side of things. I will continue work on Monte Carlo this week and keep you updated with the progress I make.

# Context
Hey there, so this will mostly be a quick post to give a plan as to what I'm going to be doing throughout the coming weeks and what I need to look into for the coming weeks in accordance with the project I'm doing with Sam and Morgan.

For some context:

* Sam and Morgan are two of my classmates that I haven't mentioned previously

* As a part of the course, for year 12, there is a project that we will do for 3 terms (2-4)

* This project is going to be used not only for the assignment but also for PyCon which will be held in person ... \[[About](https://2023.pycon.org.au/)\]

* We have a first target for the project to be finished a basic version (something that can actually be accomplished in a term) around the end of term 2

**NOTE**: The points above are the exact same as in the Web Dev post, but they give context to the project in case you haven't read it

# The Project
Great, now that we have context, here's the idea:

Sam, Morgan and I will be building a robot dog named W.I.N.S.T.O.N.. They will be working on the robotics side of it while I will be working on a server side (if that's what we wanna call it). This means that I will be taking in the data from what W.I.N.S.T.O.N. sees through Computer Vision (CV) and will be creating a 3D mesh of it using ASCII characters in Blender which will be output in (almost) real time. Now this is just the Data Science side of it and Web Dev will have it's own part which will be explained in its designated post.

Here's what I will have to look into to make this work.

|To Do|Done|
|-|-|
|Explore how Python interacts with Blender| |
|Create Mesh with Python in Blender| |
|Explore data output of CV||
|Create mesh with output of CV||
|Make mesh with ASCII characters||
|Constantly render mesh (Sort of)||
|Any other ideas will be added to the table if this changes||

This table will be placed in the future posts so that I can refer back to it and continually work through the different items, with that I should be able to get the renderer up and running. To actually receive the data, though, I will need to create a connection between my computer and Winston to create a constant data stream that can be inputted into blender (This will be a part of the Web Dev, but if it changes, the table will update).

I'm looking forward to implementing this in the coming weeks, I'll keep you updated.

**NOTE**: There wasn't much data science work to do in the holidays, so I had a conversation with the boys on what each of us will need to do and what we actually want to do with W.I.N.S.T.O.N. so that we can start planning what each of us will start looking into.

**NOTE 2**: For info on the Web Dev side of the project see [here](https://joush007.github.io/blog/timetostartwebproject)

Last week we were looking into preparations for the presentations we will be giving on our projects next week. The main point of this was to do a short presentation on the project we have been doing to get a feel for how we need to present in our final presentation. We talked for about 5-10 minutes each about our projects and got some minor feedback about how we could adapt our presentations to better fit the format, and so that we could get a better understanding of how it will feel to present in front of people (although it was not very long).

I was up first out of everyone and I presented the neural network that I was working on (as I am now working on a Convolutional Neural Network as you'll see in the next post). It was a very simple and quick presentation but I also got a little bit of real time feedback on the things that I did right or wrong and how I could do better.

The format of the talks went like this:

1. Introduce the project
2. Outline the fundamental theories and algorithms behind the project
3. Outline implementation of the project
4. Demo the project

I went through each of these 4 steps briefly (as I didn't have the time to go through them in depth) for the presentation, making sure that I will be able to talk more in depth on the actual presentation and understanding these steps. This is great practice for when I will have to present in front of the panel who will be critiquing the project (including Mr. Griffin), and so he is trying to make sur ewe have the best chance at doing our best in the presentation.

I will not have any time to continue working on my web dev project before it's due next week, and so instead I will finish working on the CNN and the presentation as well as fixing up any small bugs that may be present before it's due. I will continue posting updates weekly until the term ends.

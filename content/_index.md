Oh hey there, thanks for stoppin by. Welcome to my blog site. Here I've got all my blog posts updating you on what exactly I'm working on in different aspects of I.T.. It's best to expect 2 posts a week, one on a data science topic and one on a web development topic, with the possibility of others posts if I find something interesting to work on or if I cover other extensions of the work.
